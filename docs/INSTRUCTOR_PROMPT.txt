Create a complete, production-ready `docs/INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.html` for the `kitchen-app` workshop.

Primary goal:
- Build an instructor-facing, zero-ambiguity delivery guide that enables teaching this project end-to-end in classroom/lab settings.
- Include minute-by-minute facilitation flow, commands, checkpoints, recovery paths, and coaching notes.
- Must align exactly with `docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.html` execution order and technical behavior.

Output constraints:
- Create/update only: `docs/INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.html`
- Self-contained HTML (inline CSS + JS), readable dark-theme layout.
- Add copy button to every code block.
- Add OS tabs for Windows PowerShell, macOS, Linux command variants.
- Include quick-jump sidebar navigation.

Required sections (in this order):
1) Workshop outcomes and instructor responsibilities
2) Delivery modes (full-day, half-day, fast-track)
3) Pre-class setup checklist (instructor machine + student machines)
4) Environment validation script usage (`scripts/preflight-check.ps1`) and interpretation
5) Terminal orchestration plan (which terminal for what, including background port-forwards)
6) Phase-by-phase instructor runbook (mapped to student phases 0–7)
7) Live verification checkpoints after each phase
8) Common student failure patterns + rapid diagnosis prompts
9) “Kubernetes 0/1 READY” incident playbook (copy-paste commands)
10) Monitoring/Grafana teaching script and expected panel behavior
11) CI/CD teaching script (workflow, branch strategy, PR flow, Actions troubleshooting)
12) Git/GitHub classroom pitfalls and fix paths
13) Timeboxed facilitation script (minute-by-minute)
14) Demo script for final presentation
15) Debrief rubric and grading/assessment checklist

Critical content requirements:
A) Must include all real-world corrections discovered in execution:
- First install:
  - `npm install` first in fresh repo (lockfile creation), then lint/test
  - explain when to switch to `npm ci`
- PowerShell JSON:
  - prefer `Invoke-RestMethod` for POST JSON
  - include exact safe examples
- Compose:
  - do not include deprecated `version:` key
- Git hygiene:
  - create `.gitignore` before first `git add`
  - never commit `node_modules`
  - handle “HEAD not found” on first commit flow
- Git repo status:
  - handle “not a git repository”
  - include `git init` path and remote setup path
- Push rejection:
  - handle “fetch first” and unrelated histories safely via branch/PR workflow
- CI file path:
  - create `.github/workflows` before `ci-cd.yml`
- K8s deployment order:
  - namespace -> config/secret -> db -> api -> web-ui
- Service-name realism:
  - always validate via `kubectl get svc -n kitchen-app`
  - warn against literal placeholders (e.g. `<actual-web-ui-service-name>`)
- Windows networking:
  - NodePort can fail locally; use port-forward fallback
  - each port-forward in separate terminal; endpoint dies when terminal closes
- Monitoring order:
  - apply `prometheus-config.yaml`, then `grafana-dashboard.yaml`, then `grafana-deployment.yaml`
- Grafana rollout fix:
  - if missing configmap mount, apply dashboard configmap and restart rollout
- Counter metrics in Grafana:
  - if panel shows 0, verify in Prometheus first
  - use `sum(increase(kitchen_orders_created_total[5m]))` for stable panel behavior

B) Instructor runbook detail level:
For each phase include:
- Teaching objective
- What students should have before phase starts
- Instructor demo steps (exact commands)
- Student execution steps (exact commands)
- “Stop-and-check” gate (expected outputs)
- Typical mistakes and immediate fixes
- Escalation path if gate fails
- Estimated time (min)
- Optional deep-dive talking points

C) Minute-by-minute schedule:
- Provide at least 3 schedule variants:
  - 8-hour full workshop
  - 4-hour condensed
  - 2-hour executive demo
- For each block:
  - time window
  - instructor action
  - student action
  - checkpoint artifact (what must be visible)
  - fallback plan if behind schedule

D) Instructor troubleshooting prompts:
Include scripted prompts instructors can ask students, e.g.:
- “Run `kubectl get pods -n kitchen-app` and read STATUS/READY”
- “Show `kubectl get svc -n kitchen-app` before port-forward”
- “Paste exact error, command, and phase number”
- “Confirm which localhost port you are using and why”

E) CI/CD classroom flow:
- Step-by-step for:
  - branch creation
  - commit strategy
  - push
  - PR creation
  - Actions verification
- Include failure handling:
  - missing workflow file
  - wrong workflow path
  - branch not tracked
  - merge conflicts (especially `.gitignore`)
  - unrelated histories after local init

F) Validation checklists (must be actionable):
- Pre-class validation checklist
- Per-phase readiness checklist
- Final environment sign-off checklist
- “Production-readiness gap” checklist (what this workshop covers vs what remains)

G) HTML usability:
- Add collapsible “Instructor Notes” and “Student-facing Script” blocks.
- Add “Copy” button to code blocks.
- Add callouts for:
  - Must-do
  - Nice-to-do
  - Common pitfall
  - Recovery command set

Do not:
- Leave unresolved placeholders.
- Use vague statements like “verify it works.”
- Skip OS-specific command differences where relevant.
- Assume NodePort works on Windows without fallback.

After generating `docs/INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.html`, run a self-consistency pass:
- Ensure all resource names match manifests used in student flow
- Ensure command order respects dependencies
- Ensure all verify steps include exact expected outcomes
- Ensure monitoring and CI sections reflect production-style execution and realistic troubleshooting
- Ensure guide is teachable by a different instructor with no prior context
