Create a complete, production-ready `docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.html` for the `kitchen-app` project.

Goal:
- Build a zero-ambiguity, end-to-end student execution guide that a brand-new user can follow in Windows PowerShell, macOS, and Linux without guessing.
- Include every minute step from folder setup through local run, Kubernetes deploy, monitoring, CI/CD, troubleshooting, and final validation.

Hard requirements:
1) Output file:
- Create/update only: `docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.html`
- Self-contained HTML (inline CSS + JS) with clean dark-theme formatting.
- Add copy button for every code block.
- Add OS tabs (Windows/macOS/Linux) for all command sections.

2) Structure:
- Phase 0: Prerequisites + folder bootstrap + Git bootstrap
- Phase 1: API files
- Phase 2: Docker/local compose
- Phase 3: Kubernetes core manifests
- Phase 4: Kubernetes execution + gate checks
- Phase 5: CI/CD workflow
- Phase 6: Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Phase 7: Simulation behavior
- Kubernetes 0/1 READY troubleshooting playbook
- Final end-to-end validation
- Every phase must have: What, Why, How, Verify, Failure causes, Notes

3) Must include exact practical fixes discovered in real run:
- First install flow:
  - For fresh repo: `npm install` first (creates lockfile), then lint/test
  - Explain when `npm ci` is valid
- PowerShell-safe JSON POST:
  - Prefer `Invoke-RestMethod` for POST JSON
  - Avoid fragile escaping examples
- Remove deprecated Compose version key:
  - Do not use `version:` in compose snippet
- Git bootstrapping:
  - Include `git init` path for fresh folder
  - Add `.gitignore` creation before first `git add`
  - Include guard for first-commit `HEAD` issue
  - Include steps to avoid committing `node_modules`
- CI file path creation:
  - Explicitly create `.github/workflows` before `ci-cd.yml`
- K8s dependency-safe order:
  - namespace -> secrets/configmaps -> db -> api -> web-ui
  - include exact commands and rollout waits
- Service-name reality checks:
  - Always instruct users to confirm actual names via `kubectl get svc -n kitchen-app`
  - Use current names where applicable (`api-nodeport`, `api`, `web-ui-service`, `prometheus-service`, `grafana-service`)
  - Warn not to run placeholders like `<actual-web-ui-service-name>` literally
- Port-forward behavior:
  - Explicitly state: run each port-forward in separate terminal and keep open
  - Mention endpoint stops if terminal closes
  - Include Ctrl+C exit note for watch/forward commands
- Monitoring order fix:
  - Apply `k8s/monitoring/prometheus-config.yaml`
  - Apply `k8s/monitoring/grafana-dashboard.yaml`
  - Then apply `k8s/monitoring/grafana-deployment.yaml`
- Grafana troubleshooting:
  - If `configmap "grafana-dashboards" not found`, apply dashboard configmap then rollout restart
- Metrics validation nuance:
  - If Grafana panel shows 0/No data, verify in Prometheus first
  - Include recommended counter query:
    - `sum(increase(kitchen_orders_created_total[5m]))`
  - Include target health check in Prometheus (`Status -> Targets` must be UP)
- NodePort on Windows:
  - Mention NodePort may fail on localhost with Docker Desktop
  - Provide port-forward fallback commands

4) Dynamic code-block explainer behavior:
- Before each code block, show:
  - What
  - Why
  - How
  - Verify
- These must be context-aware (file/phase specific), not generic.
- Ensure Prometheus/Grafana blocks do not accidentally reuse API deployment descriptions.

5) Command accuracy:
- Provide OS-specific command variants where needed.
- Use PowerShell syntax for Windows blocks.
- Ensure all commands are runnable and in correct sequence.
- Include “expected output” style verification criteria after critical steps.

6) Troubleshooting section (must be explicit copy-paste):
- CreateContainerConfigError
- ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull / ErrImageNeverPull
- Probe failures
- Mongo not ready
- Service NotFound
- Namespace NotFound
- Empty/invalid YAML (`no objects passed to apply`)
- Grafana rollout timeout / failed mount configmap
- JSON parsing errors from wrong PowerShell quoting
- “not a git repository”
- push rejected (remote main has history) and safe branch/PR approach

7) Final quality bar:
- No placeholders left unresolved.
- No condensed snippets for critical files (especially web-ui and dashboard definitions).
- Student should be able to execute end-to-end from a fresh folder with no ambiguity.
- Keep wording instructional and deterministic.

After generating `docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.html`, self-check:
- verify all phase commands are dependency-correct
- verify Windows POST examples use PowerShell-safe syntax
- verify monitoring order is dashboard-before-grafana-deployment
- verify CI folder creation is included
- verify `.gitignore` and Git-first-commit guidance is included
- verify all `port-forward` commands explicitly say separate terminal
